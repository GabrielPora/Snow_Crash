Find that /etc/passwd doesn't have the regulary permission, you can actually read it so we will want to cat it


 get it
 `scp -P 4242 level01@[ip]:/etc/passwd .`
 example of this below
 `scp -P 4242 level00@192.168.56.102:/etc/passwd .`
 note that I gave level00 instead of level01 as this works for it since we have level00 password being `level00` 
 for level01 passwd being `x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias`

 This now created a file in the current folder called passwd
 You will now use the tool john to decrypt the passwd file
 `john passwd`
 Use `john passwd --show` to display reliably

 you will get an output like this:
 ```
root@kali:~# john passwd 
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (descrypt, traditional crypt(3) [DES 128/128 AVX-16])
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
abcdefg          (flag01)
1g 0:00:00:00 DONE 2/3 (2017-10-23 04:30) 12.50g/s 17375p/s 17375c/s 17375C/s raquel..bigman
Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed
root@kali:~# john passwd --show
flag01:abcdefg:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash

1 password hash cracked, 0 left
root@kali:~#
 ```

 you can see the password for the flag01 is `abcdefg`

 `su flag01`
 passwd `abcdefg`
